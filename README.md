## Demo

Before anything, here you have a little example of how it looks.

<p align="center"><img src="doc/img/demo.gif" height="450"></p>

The code comes with a demo program showing the basic functionalities provided by the library. In it you can place lights and blocks that will cast shadows, and modify the opacity of the fog.

#### Controls

- **Right click**. Alternate between block and light.
- **Left click**. Put a block or light.
- **Spacebar**. Erase all lights and blocks. 

- **Mouse wheel**. Increase / Decrease light radius.

- **G**. Toggle glow.
- **C**. Alternate glow color between white, magenta, yellow and cyan. 
- **A** / **S**. Increase / Decrease light intensity. 

- **Z** / **X**. Increase / Decrease fog opacity.

- **P**. Capture  the window content and save it to a png file in the current working directory.

#### Build

You can build the static library and the demo program with CMake.

```cmake
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_DEMO=ON
cmake --build .
```

This will generate libCandle-s.a or (Candle-s.lib on Windows) in build/lib folder, and demo program (or demo.exe) in build/bin.

## Requisites

<img src="https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/goodies/sfml-icon.svg" height="50">

- **SFML v2.5** 
  - Graphics module and System module.

_This library is meant to be used in SFML applications, so it's assumed that you are familiar with the process of compiling them. If you are not, [you can learn in the official website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/)_ . 

## Example program

I will assume that you have SFML installed in your system. If we have a project with the following structure:

```
|- project
   |- libCandle-s.a
   |- main.cpp
   |- include
      |- Candle   # Candle headers
         |- Lighting.hpp
         |- LightSource.hpp
         |- Util.hpp
```

the `main.cpp` file could look like this:

```C++
#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>
#include "Candle/Lighting.hpp"

int main(){
    // create window
    sf::RenderWindow w(sf::VideoMode(400,400), "app");
    
    // create the lighting area
    candle::Lighting lighting;
    lighting.setFogOpacity(0.6);
    lighting.adjustFog(w.getView());
    lighting.updateFog();
    
    // create the light and a shadow to cast
    candle::LightSource light;
    light.setRadius(150);
    lighting.addLightSource(&light);
    lighting.m_segmentPool.push_back({{200,100},{200,300}});
    
    // main loop
    while(w.isOpen()){
        sf::Event e;
        while(w.pollEvent(e)){
            if(e.type == sf::Event::Closed){
                w.close();
            }else if(e.type == sf::Event::MouseMoved){
                // make the light follow the mouse
                sf::Vector2i mpi = sf::Mouse::getPosition(w);
                light.setPosition(sf::Vector2f(mpi.x,mpi.y));
                light.castLight();
            }
        }
        
        w.clear();
        w.draw(lighting);
        w.display();
    }
	return 0;
}

```

We can compile it with the following command:

```shell
g++ -o app main.cpp -Iinclude -L. -lCandle-s -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```

And we run it

```shell
./app
```

The result will be a simple light casting a shadow over an invisible wall in the center of the window.

## Contributing

Here's a To Do list for Candle:

- Currently this library needs more testing and documentation.

  - **Performance tests** - this library is not yet optimized.
  - **Functionality tests** - there may be bugs I haven't found yet.
  - **Tutorials and examples**.
  - **Documentation review** - [the documentation](https://miguelmj.github.io/Candle) still needs some more writing and maybe spell checking.
- The functionalities of the library are enough for a basic lighting system, but there is still room for **more complex behaviours**.
  - Some of the features I plan to implement are:
    - _More type of light sources_ (directional, flashlight, etc).
    - _More customization for the light intensity_ - Currently is simply linear; maximum intensity in the origin, zero in the radius; I'd like to add more options to customize that.
  - If you want to request some feel free to open a new issue ![](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/MiguelMJ/Candle?logo=github&style=social) or even implement it and make a pull request.
- Use of several technologies I'm still not very familiar with.
  - Use **shaders** to blur the light or create a penumbra effect.
  - Implement the algorithms with **Box2D** ray casting and add a **compiler option** to use them instead of the ones I coded (this feature is inspired by the optional use of [fmtlib](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) in the [loguru](https://github.com/emilk/loguru) project).
- The integration is simple, but it would be even simpler with a **better build system** (use Make/CMake to compile a static library, maybe).
- Finally, you can still  :star:  **star this repository** and give it some visibility ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/MiguelMJ/Candle?style=social).
